"question": "What is the latest evolution in Slack's platform, particularly concerning AI, as announced at the Salesforce World Tour event?",
"answer": "Slack has advanced from a pure communications platform to one facilitating direct integration with enterprise applications. At the Salesforce World Tour event in NYC, the company unveiled plans to place AI at the forefront of the user experience, aiming to enhance information retrieval and workflow creation. Notably, these features are still in development. The incorporation of AI into Slack involves various integrations, including SlackGPT, the company's generative AI built on the Slack platform. SlackGPT leverages the wealth of institutional knowledge within Slack's messages, files, and shared content to enable users and developers to build AI-driven experiences. The goal is to bring AI natively into the user experience with features like AI-powered conversation summaries and writing assistance directly available in Slack. Additionally, developers can integrate AI into workflows, tapping into external apps and large language models. EinsteinGPT, Salesforce's generative AI, will also be integrated into Slack, allowing employees to ask questions directly related to Salesforce content, enhancing teams' understanding of customer data. While these capabilities are still in development, Slack aims to provide users with flexibility and choice in incorporating AI into their work. SlackGPT and EinsteinGPT integration are in the development phase, but developers can already build custom integrations with various large language models (LLMs). Workflow Builder with SlackGPT AI connectors will be available this summer, allowing customers to connect ChatGPT or Claude to workflows or build custom connectors for their own LLMs.",
